          <p>The article <a href="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay"><q>Pricing Pixels: Breaking Down the Barriers of Selling Digital Art</q></a> by <strong>Kyle Chayka</strong> <sub>(2014)</sub> effectively informs readers about the value of digital art which is changing more from the financial aspect. In another word, he believes this market is changing so fast and it is more about the money, not reputation and respect. He effectively explained the details of limitations of selling digital art in the past, how it has changed, who has succeeded and what digital artists are thinking about the aforementioned changes in this digital market. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p> The author effectively gave examples of commercial auctions and exhibitions to inform readers of how the prices of digital art were surprisingly unpredictable even for artists. The author’s study found the following: </p>

          <blockquote cite="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay">That Howard and her artists drew a crowd wasn’t surprising, but the final results of the auction may have come as a shock to those who still believe digital art doesn’t have a place in the wider art market. The 17 lots that went to the block sold for a grand total of $90,600. <a href="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay">(Chayka, <q class="quotes">Pricing Pixels…</q>)</a></blockquote>

          <p>For Howard and her artists selling a digital art with a high price was a dream but by using <a href="https://paddleson.tumblr.com/about"> Paddles On!</a>they could sell their items even more than they could imagine. They weren’t surprised by the crowd; however, they were not looking for making a reputation for themselves and waiting for the final results. They successfully sold their digital artwork by using <a href="https://paddleson.tumblr.com/about"> Paddles On!</a>. The limitation of selling digital art appeared to be due to a lack of easy-to-access equipment and knowledge about the collector, however everything changed by these commercial auctions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>He mentioned people's experiences in selling their digital art including their point of view and an explanation of how the digital market is quickly changing. The author’s research found the following:
          <blockquote cite="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay"><em>Rafael Rozendaal</em> was grateful for the auction’s efforts toward building a market, though he was initially nervous—the space and the context “felt very formal.” “It's important to create interest and economy so I can be a fulltime dreamer,” he explained. <a href="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay">(Chayka, <q>Pricing Pixels…</q>)</a></blockquote></p>

          <p>Rafael thinks that the auction was the reason for the price changes. He explains why he likes auctions and what his problem was. He didn’t like that the digital artwork was part of formal events, rather he believes that auctions create excitement in this market. Initially the context and the space were too formal for his taste however he believed commercial auctions and the auction economy would create excitement in this market.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Digital art is modern and artists can sell their digital art more easily than before. Also, many of them are starting their first step by selling their product in auction houses and online. The author states, <q>But unlike modernist painting, digital art is an untested market—many of the artists in <a href="https://paddleson.tumblr.com/about"> Paddles On!</a> don’t even have gallery representation, let alone auction records</q><a href="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay">(Chayka, <q>Pricing Pixels…</q>)</a>. As he mentioned, modernist paintings and digital art are not at the same level in the market. The author effectively proves that digital artists care more about their financial prospects rather than fame and respect. So, because of that, they are not interested in having their own gallery. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Previously, digital artists couldn’t make money by selling their digital artwork like today. They just had a bunch of likes and comments which formed their work’s reputation. However, the author’s research found the following:</p>

          <blockquote cite="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay"> The currency of the day was <del>respect</del>, entrance into online archives, and a bunch of likes and comments. It paid no bills, but a sustainable digital art community needs both critical dialogue and an outlet to the market to keep it going. <a href="https://www.complex.com/style/2014/01/digital-art-essay">(Chayka, <q>Pricing Pixels…</q>)</a></blockquote>

          <p>Now, the auctions opened the path and opportunity for them to enter a pervasive market. Digital art didn’t have a price value before because no one expected to make this much money with them, but now the situation has changed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In conclusion, the digital market changed so fast that even the digital artists were surprised. Aside from bringing the auction towards a conventional process, this commercialization created an easier path for the digital artists to present their work. When the commercial auction like <a href="https://paddleson.tumblr.com/about"> Paddles On!</a> stepped on the market, digital artists can actually sell their digital artwork for a high price rather than evaluating their work based on opinions and comments of others. </p>
